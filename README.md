# Bluetooth-ArtBot
ArtBot is a Bluetooth controlled tricycle drawing robot that drags a sharpie behind it  to leave marks behind its path. It can draw in straight lines or in concentric curves with  responsive control from Adafruitâ€™s Bluefruit SPI mobile app for Android or iOS. A 9V battery  powers an Arduino microcontroller and the bluetooth module while a 2 cell LiPo battery  powers a motor shield connected to the Arduino and two stepper motors which turn the  wheels allowing smooth, consistent rolling on the drawing surface.
